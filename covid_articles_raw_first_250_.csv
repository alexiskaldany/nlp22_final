Looking into the truth about modern workplace environments,"Hi, what are you looking for?

Workplaces are being transformed, according to the Olivet Nazarene University study ( “ The Truth about Modern Offices “). The days of men and women fitted in formal clothing and working under the harsh glare fluorescent lighting are slipping away. The trends of today are reflective of casual dress codes and soft furnishings.
There are signs too that the ‘ animal penning’ ( read cubicles) are starting to be withdrawn, and replaced with open floor plans ( indications are that over half of workplaces – 51 percent – have gravitated towards the ‘ open office’ or open floor plan concept).
The survey also showed that 77 percent of U.S. located workers are reportedly happy with the way their office is set up. However, as an indication of thoughts about open-plan areas, those with private offices stated they were happiest
Through changing technology, more employees are now having more daily conversations via messaging apps rather than face-to-face interactions ( for every 17 conversations, nine are via messaging systems against eight that are face-to-face). An example of such a system is Skype for Business.
The poll also found that 58 percent of U.S. citizens self-report they are less productive when working from home. The main reasons for this loss of productivity include distractions, trouble signing off at the end of the day and difficulty communicating and collaborating with coworkers. Furthermore, 80 percent of those ‘ homeworking’ freely admitted to multitasking. By this, people are choosing to focus on things like laundry, family, or television. So while remote working takes off, there are some apparent downsides to this trend.
The data was compiled between November 15 and November 17, 2019. Encompassed in the survey were 2,009 people, who were polled about their current workplace environments. The mean age of the participants was 37 years. By gender, 55 percent of the respondents were female and 45 percent were male.

"Japan raid, Turkey arrests in widening Ghosn probe","Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Officials on Thursday raided the Tokyo residence of former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn who fled to Lebanon to avoid a Japanese trial, while Turkey detained several people as part of a widening probe into the security lapse.
Ghosn, who faced multiple charges of financial misconduct that he denies, won bail in April but with strict conditions -- including a ban on overseas travel.
But the disgraced executive, who has French, Brazilian and Lebanese nationalities, managed to slip out of Japan on Sunday despite having handed over his three passports to his lawyers.
A court in Tokyo had allowed Ghosn to keep a second French passport as he needed one to travel inside Japan, a source close to the matter told AFP Thursday.
`` He had to keep this passport '' to prove his short-stay status, the source said, adding: `` There was permission from the court. ''
Ghosn was allowed this French passport so long as it was kept in a locked case with the code held by his lawyers, the source said.
There is no emigration data showing Ghosn's departure from Japan but he entered Lebanon on a French passport, public broadcaster NHK said.
Colourful rumours abound regarding the exact circumstances of Ghosn's daring escape.
One claim in the Lebanese media was that the mogul was sprung from his Tokyo residence in a musical instrument case -- a story a source in his entourage denied.
He is thought to have taken a private jet from Kansai Airport in western Japan on December 29, heading for Istanbul. It is believed Ghosn headed from there to Beirut.
Turkey's interior ministry has opened an investigation into Ghosn's apparent transfer between private jets at an Istanbul airport on Monday.
Officials questioned seven people, including four pilots, as part of the probe, news agency DHA reported Thursday.
- Residence raided -
Prosecutors, meanwhile, raided his former Tokyo residence Thursday as part of an initial investigation into his escape.
Television footage showed several officers in dark suits entering the property.
Authorities are expected to analyse security camera footage from his residence and other places they suspect Ghosn travelled to before he fled, NHK said.
Police suspect `` several '' people accompanied him to help him escape `` in an unlawful manner, '' it added.
The Japanese government has yet to issue any official statement on the case.
When his defence lawyers were arguing for bail, prosecutors claimed he was a flight risk with powerful connections, but Ghosn himself said he wanted to be tried to prove his innocence.
One of his lawyers also said at the time that he was such a famous face he had no chance of slipping away undetected.
Several countries allow peopleto have two passports of the same nationality -- for example if they are frequent travellers constantly needing visas, or visit nations in conflict with each other.
The Japanese government is likely to ask Lebanon to extradite Ghosn through diplomatic channels, but chances of his handover appear slim as Beiruit has no extradition accord with Tokyo.
The French government said on Thursday it would not extradite Ghosn if he arrived in the country because it does not extradite its nationals.

Pope's bodyguards criticised over slapping incident,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Pope Francis's attempt to wrest himself from the grasp of an ardent follower this week have left some asking -- where was the pontiff's security detail?
Often dubbed the `` People's Pope, '' Francis's ability to engage with crowds -- and his apparent relish in doing so -- puts him in close proximity with the throngs who gather to greet him.
Whether taking selfies with the faithful, shaking hands, or blessing children, the head of 1.3 billion Catholics around the world is protected by bodyguards from a special corps charged with the pope's security.
But on New Year's Eve in Saint Peter's Square, televised images showed a woman behind a barricade grabbing Francis's hand, while three men in black can be seen in the background.
The Pope swats at the woman's hand to free himself, before one of the men is seen restraining her hands. Francis later apologised for setting a `` bad example. ''
By Thursday, after the images circulated online, some people took to Twitter to question how the incident could have happened.
`` The guy has a literal army to protect him and has to do his own slapping? '' asked one Twitter user.
Another commented: `` The Pope has a very lax security detail. ''
The Vatican's security department declined to comment.
One security expert however said bodyguards should have intervened earlier.
`` It's the Pope's security team who should be apologising, '' said the founder of Italy's elite special police interventions unit, whose identity is protected but who goes by the name Commandant Alfa.
`` The lady wouldn't let go of the Pope's hand, and he was forced to slap her hand a little bit in order to get out of the way, '' Alfa told the AGI news agency. `` But it shouldn't have gotten to that point. ''
The pope's chief bodyguard and head of Vatican security, Domenico Giani, resigned in October after an internal security memo related to a Vatican financial probe was leaked to the press.
- Personal style -
Papal security became a top priority at the Vatican after the 1981 assassination attempt of pope Jean Paul II by Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk, in Saint Peter's Square. Heightened security measures that followed included making the Popemobile bulletproof and the addition of metal detectors on entering the square.
Francis told a Spanish newspaper in 2014 he preferred not to use the bulletproof Popemobile, likening it to a `` sardine can. ''
But even overly enthusiastic fans have posed security risks. In 2009, before a Christmas Eve Mass given by then pope Benedict XVI, a woman who later said she wanted to give the pontiff a hug jumped over a barricade and grabbed his robes, pulling the 82-year-old to the ground. Benedict was not injured but a French cardinal broke his leg in the melee.
When Francis became pope in 2013, his low-key style and desire to bring the Roman Catholic Church closer to the people posed new headaches for the Vatican's elaborate security team, whose colourful Swiss Guards are the most visible members.
`` You have to respect the personal style of each pope, '' said Francis's spokesman at the time, Federico Lombardi.
`` It's not for the heads of security to decide these things. ''

Lebanon denies president welcomed fugitive Ghosn,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The Lebanese presidency on Thursday denied reports that President Michel Aoun had welcomed fugitive former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn upon his arrival in the country.
The French-Lebanese tycoon, who had been under house arrest in Japan over several counts of financial misconduct, escaped in mysterious circumstances and arrived in Beirut on Monday.
Several media outlets reported that he had been greeted by Aoun but a senior presidency official denied the two men had met.
`` He was not received at the presidency and did not meet the president, '' the official told AFP.
Ghosn flew in from Istanbul on a private jet and has since been reunited with friends and family.
Ghosn said he would speak to the media next week. One of his lawyers in Lebanon, Carlos Abou Jaoude, said a date for the press conference had yet to be determined.
He entered Lebanon on a French passport, according to airport documents seen by AFP.
The public Japanese broadcaster NHK reported that the court in Tokyo had allowed Ghosn to keep a second French passport so long as it were kept `` in a locked case '' with the key held by his lawyers.
The exact circumstances of Ghosn's daring escape from Japan, where he had been released on bail in April pending trial after 130 days in prison, remain unclear, though colourful rumours abound.
One claim in the Lebanese media is that the auto mogul, who holds Lebanese, French and Brazilian nationalities, was sprung from his Tokyo residence in a musical instrument case -- a story a source in his entourage denied.
How Ghosn was able to jump bail has led to a Japanese investigation into what is seen as an embarrassing security lapse.
Ghosn stands accused of deferring part of his salary until after his retirement and concealing this from shareholders, as well as syphoning off millions in Nissan cash for his own purposes.
Ghosn has repeatedly denied all charges against him, and said that he fled to Lebanon to escape a `` rigged '' Japanese justice system.
Some Lebanese see Ghosn as a symbol of their country's fabled entrepreneurial genius and a proud representative of its vast diaspora.
The mood has changed since his November 2018 arrest, however, and, weeks into an unprecedented wave of protests against corruption and nepotism, activists saw his return as another manifestation of privilege and impunity for the super-rich.

Lebanese lawyers want Ghosn prosecuted over Israel trip,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Lebanese lawyers on Thursday filed a report to the judiciary demanding fugitive auto tycoon Carlos Ghosn be prosecuted over a trip he made to Israel as Renault-Nissan chairman in 2008.
Ghosn -- who holds Lebanese, French and Brazilian citizenship -- jumped bail in Tokyo in mysterious circumstances and arrived in his native Lebanon early on Monday.
The tycoon had travelled to Israel in 2008 to support a partnership with Shai Agassi, an Israeli entrepreneur who had launched an ill-fated electric vehicle venture called `` Project Better Place ''.
Three lawyers `` submitted a report to the public prosecutor against businessman Carlos Ghosn for the crime of having entered an enemy country and violated the boycott law, '' the state news agency reported.
They said several contracts had been signed during his January 2008 trip and added that Ghosn had taken part in several economic conferences.
`` Doing business with Israel is not a matter of opinion -- any normalisation is forbidden by law, '' Hassan Bazzi, one of the lawyers, told AFP.
Lebanon is technically still at war with Israel, which occupied the south of the country until 2000, and forbids its citizens from travelling there.
Interpol, the international police cooperation body, has issued a `` red notice '' for Ghosn's arrest in the wake of him fleeing Japan, but Lebanese judicial sources have said he can not be extradited there.
Ghosn stands accused in Japan of deferring part of his salary until after his retirement and concealing this from shareholders, as well as syphoning off millions in Nissan cash for his own purposes.
He has denied all charges and has announced a press conference for next week.
Ghosn entered Lebanon on a private jet from Turkey using his French passport, according to airport documents seen by AFP.
`` Where were the public prosecutor and general security when Ghosn visited Lebanon, after he travelled to occupied Palestine and was photographed there?, '' Bazzi asked.
General security is Lebanon's main intelligence agency, which routinely investigates Lebanese citizens suspected of ties with Israel.
`` Lebanon prosecutes poor people while those who have earned millions by investing with the enemy are treated as national heroes, '' Bazzi said.

"' I did it alone ', Ghosn says of Japan escape","Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Carlos Ghosn claimed Thursday he organised his dramatic escape from bail in Japan alone as the disgraced auto tycoon enjoyed his first days of freedom in Beirut despite an Interpol arrest notice.
The exact circumstances of the former Renault-Nissan boss's escape from a case he said was `` rigged '' were unclear but media reports described a plot that had all the trappings of a spy novel.
Turkey said seven people had been detained for questioning, including four pilots, over how the wanted tycoon was able to transit through Istanbul.
Ghosn, who had been under house arrest in Tokyo since April, was believed to be holed up his central Beirut residence, where visitors filed in and out under the scrutiny of TV cameras.
His surprise return to Lebanon just before New Year's Eve raised fresh questions over his judicial status and marked the latest twist in a saga that has rocked the automotive and business world for more than a year.
Lebanon's state news agency quoted Justice Minister Albert Sarhan as announcing that `` the public prosecutor... has received what is known as a red notice from Interpol in the Carlos Ghosn case ''.
An Interpol red notice is a request for a provisional arrest, pending extradition or prosecution, but it is not a warrant.
- Private operatives -
A Lebanese judicial source has already told AFP however that Lebanon and Japan do not have an extradition agreement under which Ghosn -- who holds Lebanese, French and Brazilian nationalities -- could be sent back to Tokyo.
Ghosn stands accused in Japan of deferring part of his salary until after his retirement and concealing this from shareholders, as well as syphoning off millions in Nissan cash for his own purposes.
His escape caused deep embarrassment in Japan, where prosecutors launched an investigation into the security lapse and on Thursday searched his residence.
Japanese authorities are expected to analyse security camera footage from his residence and other places they suspect Ghosn travelled to before he fled, Japanese broadcaster NHK said.
According to Japan's Kyodo news agency, Ghosn was smuggled out with the help of two private security operatives who pretended to be part of a music band for a Christmas party at his residence.
Quoting a Lebanese consultant in Tokyo, Kyodo said Ghosn hid in an instrument case before boarding a private jet -- a scenario a member of Ghosn's entourage has previously denied.
One of the operatives was a former Marine employed by a US security firm while the second worked for a Lebanese firm, Kyodo said.
More details could emerge when the former tycoon, who was first arrested in November 2018, speaks to the press in Beirut next week.
- Turkey arrests -
Ghosn denied through the Paris-based agency handling his PR that his family had anything to do with his escape.
`` The media reports saying my wife Carole and other family members played a role in my departure from Japan are falsehoods. I alone organised my departure, '' he said.
Meanwhile Turkey also announced that it was holding seven individuals in connection with Ghosn's extraordinary escape.
The investigation is focused on two flights.
The first, a Bombardier labelled TC-TSR, flew from Osaka in Japan, landed in Istanbul at 5:15 am and parked in a hangar.
The second was a private jet to Beirut, a Bombardier Challenger 300 TC-RZA, which left 45 minutes later, according to the Turkish news agency DHA.
Ghosn was able to enter Lebanon on a French passport, according to airport documents seen by AFP.
NHK reported that the court in Tokyo had allowed Ghosn to keep a second French passport so long as it was kept `` in a locked case '' with the key held by his lawyers.
- Privilege and impunity -
Although Ghosn was restricted to his lush Beirut home only by the media's glare, not all in Lebanon welcomed his return.
Three lawyers submitted a report to the public prosecutor demanding that the businessman be prosecuted over a trip he made to Israel in 2008.
`` Doing business with Israel is not a matter of opinion -- any normalisation is forbidden by law, '' Hassan Bazzi, one of the lawyers, told AFP.
Lebanon is technically still at war with Israel, which occupied the south of the country until 2000, and forbids its citizens from travelling there.
Ghosn had travelled to Israel and met then president Shimon Peres as part of a trip to support a partnership with an Israeli entrepreneur launching an electric car venture.
Some Lebanese see Ghosn as a symbol of their country's fabled entrepreneurial genius and a proud representative of its vast diaspora.

Quoting a Lebanese consultant in Tokyo, Kyodo said Ghosn hid in an instrument case before boarding a private jet — a scenario a member of Ghosn’ s entourage has previously denied.
One of the operatives was a former Marine employed by a US security firm while the second worked for a Lebanese firm, Kyodo said.
More details could emerge when the former tycoon, who was first arrested in November 2018, speaks to the press in Beirut next week.
– Turkey arrests –


Ghosn denied through the Paris-based agency handling his PR that his family had anything to do with his escape.
“ The media reports saying my wife Carole and other family members played a role in my departure from Japan are falsehoods. I alone organised my departure, ” he said.
Meanwhile Turkey also announced that it was holding seven individuals in connection with Ghosn’ s extraordinary escape.
The investigation is focused on two flights.
The first, a Bombardier labelled TC-TSR, flew from Osaka in Japan, landed in Istanbul at 5:15 am and parked in a hangar.
The second was a private jet to Beirut, a Bombardier Challenger 300 TC-RZA, which left 45 minutes later, according to the Turkish news agency DHA.
Ghosn was able to enter Lebanon on a French passport, according to airport documents seen by AFP.
NHK reported that the court in Tokyo had allowed Ghosn to keep a second French passport so long as it was kept “ in a locked case ” with the key held by his lawyers.
– Privilege and impunity –


Although Ghosn was restricted to his lush Beirut home only by the media’ s glare, not all in Lebanon welcomed his return.
Three lawyers submitted a report to the public prosecutor demanding that the businessman be prosecuted over a trip he made to Israel in 2008.
“ Doing business with Israel is not a matter of opinion — any normalisation is forbidden by law, ” Hassan Bazzi, one of the lawyers, told AFP.
Lebanon is technically still at war with Israel, which occupied the south of the country until 2000, and forbids its citizens from travelling there.
Ghosn had travelled to Israel and met then president Shimon Peres as part of a trip to support a partnership with an Israeli entrepreneur launching an electric car venture.
Some Lebanese see Ghosn as a symbol of their country’ s fabled entrepreneurial genius and a proud representative of its vast diaspora.
The mood has changed since his November 2018 arrest, however, and, weeks into an unprecedented wave of protests against corruption and nepotism, activists saw his return as another manifestation of privilege and impunity for the super-rich.

Ghosn escape sparks calls to toughen Japan's bail system,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Carlos Ghosn's stunning flight while on bail awaiting trial has vindicated prosecutors who said he should have been kept in custody, and sparked calls to toughen Japan's justice system that critics say is already overly harsh.
`` I knew it! '' was the reaction of a senior Nissan executive cited in the Japanese press upon learning of his former boss's escape to Lebanon to avoid trial in Tokyo.
`` This is how he proves his innocence? By fleeing abroad? '' added the Nissan official quoted in the Asahi Shimbun. `` It should be out of the question to grant bail to suspects who deny the accusations against them. ''
A senior prosecutor told the Mainichi Shimbun: `` This is what we had predicted '' when arguing Ghosn should remain in custody, bemoaning the fact their painstaking evidence gathering was now moot.
There were also calls in the media to tighten bail procedures in the wake of the tycoon's escape, which many papers said made a `` mockery '' of Japan's justice system.
`` To prevent a repeat of the incident, we should discuss how to cover the weak points of the system, such as setting bail equal to most of the defendants ' assets, and GPS monitoring, '' said the Yomiuri Shimbun.
Ghosn's high-profile arrest on multiple charges of financial misconduct threw an international spotlight on Japan's justice system -- widely considered draconian compared with the West.
Suspects can be questioned initially for 48 hours, renewable for two periods of 10 days, bringing the time in custody without formal charges to 22 days.
Prosecutors often then `` re-arrest '' a suspect on a slightly different allegation to restart the clock -- which happened several times to Ghosn.
- Certain of guilt -
When formal charges are eventually pressed, there is a two-month period of pre-trial detention, renewable by one month at a time by appeal to the court.
Former prosecutor Yasuyuki Takai told AFP that the system operates in this way so authorities only charge suspects they are absolutely sure are guilty.
`` Imagine that 30 or 40 percent of people were found not guilty during a trial. The public would ask why so many innocent people were being charged, '' Takai told AFP, adding that courts have increasingly been granting bail.
The Ghosn case, however, `` proves that there are easy escape routes for wealthy people with backing who want to flee overseas, no matter how strictly courts impose bail conditions '', said Tsunehiko Maeda, a former prosecutor.
`` We can expect prosecutors to oppose future bail requests much more robustly. ''
Critics including rights groups such as Amnesty International have derided Japan's system as `` hostage justice '', designed to break morale and force confessions from suspects.
- Every move monitored -
When safely in Lebanon, Ghosn pressed this point again, saying he `` would no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system ''.
However, when pleading for bail in his only public court appearance, Ghosn said he was `` looking forward to beginning the process of defending myself against the accusations that have been made against me ''.
One of his lawyers at the time said there was no way a tycoon as famous as Ghosn could escape with the world's media and prosecutors monitoring his every move.
`` There is no risk that he will run away. He's CEO of French company Renault. He's widely known so it's difficult for him to escape, '' argued the attorney, Go Kondo.
His lead lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, confessed he was `` dumbfounded '' by news of his flight, but he also said he could `` sympathise '' with some of Ghosn's comments about the justice system.
`` I thought it was not unreasonable that Mr. Ghosn has come to feel that way, '' Hironaka told reporters in Tokyo.
`` How he was arrested and kept in detention; how they gathered evidence; the way they allowed meetings with Carole ( his wife), and how they disclosed evidence. There must have been many areas that were not acceptable in the eyes of Mr. Ghosn. ''

Mexico's Santiago River has become a toxic 'environmental hell ',"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
In a report published on Monday, the New York Times wrote that “ Jalisco’ s heavily contaminated Santiago River is a powerful example of Mexico’ s failure to protect its environment, ”
The river flows over a giant cliff along the edge of downtown El Salto, in Jalisco State. Back in the 1970s, this spot was known as the Niagara of Mexico – a popular tourist spot with fishing and other water activities as well as beautiful scenery and lots of wildlife. That is all gone now that the El Salto and Guadalajara region has been turned into a toxic morass.
And a heavily polluted river can kill. So far, over 628 people living near the river have died. The pollution problem garnered some government attention after an eight-year-old fell into a coma and then died in 2008. Miguel Ángel López Rocha had slipped into the river while playing on its bank, and while he was immediately pulled out, 18 days later he died from what doctors said was a fatal dose of arsenic.
The outrage over the boy’ s death prompted the government to build El Ahogado, the region’ s biggest wastewater treatment plant that was inaugurated in 2012. However, it doesn’ t treat heavy metals and many synthetic chemicals that doctors say are one of the main causes of so many of the illnesses.
The death also prompted a study in 2011 by Jalisco’ s State Water Commission and the Mexican Institute of Water Technology. In the study, 1,090 different pollutants were detected in the river. They included arsenic, lead, cyanide, mercury, chromium, and hormone disruptors that can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders, among others.
No oversight with regulations in place The big problem is that there is scant oversight of some of the 10,000 businesses operating in the area because the National Water Commission ( Conagua) has just one inspector in all of Jalisco, according to Mexico News Daily.
The report noted that even when Conagua does respond to cases of illegal runoff into the Santiago River, the fines it has the power to impose are too low to act as a deterrent.
“ Texas-based chemicals company Celanese Corporation was fined just US $ 4,300 for discharging illegal quantities of waste into the river on 13 separate occasions in the summer of 2015, ” according to documents obtained by the New York Times.
In 2018, Jalisco Governor Enrique Alfaro announced that his newly-elected government would invest more than 3.4 billion pesos to tackle the pollution problem. However, when he asked the federal government for the money, he was told there were no funds available – even with the federal environment secretary calling the Santiago River an “ environmental hell. ”
The new North American free trade agreement Today, Canada, Mexico, and the United States are close to enacting the new trade deal that will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA).
Mexico made an explicit promise to conserve its environment — a provision that was central to winning approval from Democrats in the US Congress. However, the New York Times notes that after interviewing federal, state and local authorities, as well as families living along the river, the report found that: “ without an overhaul of Mexico’ s flawed legal framework and a change in the political conditions that allowed the Santiago to become little more than a channel for industrial runoff, Mexico is unlikely to be able to meet the terms of the trade deal. ” It is Mexico’ s farms and factories that fuel its economy, and all this is bound up in the new free trade agreement – one that does not allow for the dumping of illegal quantities of toxic waste into the region’ s river. waste with little or no penalty.
The federal environmental enforcement agency can also inspect companies for illegal dumping of waste. However, it was found that only 73 out of 10,000 companies were inspected in the five years leading up to 2018. “ The Santiago River is, for me, one of the most shameful, most terrible stories that Jalisco and Mexico have, ” said Governor, Enrique Alfaro.

Fired British vegan files landmark discrimination case,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a philosophical belief that must be protected in law.
Jordi Casamitjana says he was fired from an animal welfare charity for raising concerns about its pension fund's alleged investment in companies that use animal testing.
The League Against Cruel Sports -- a group that wants to ban fox and other forms of recreational hunting in Britain -- says he was dismissed for gross misconduct.
The case being heard by the employment tribunal in the eastern England city of Norwich on Thursday and Friday will determine whether ethical veganism is a `` philosophical or religious belief ''.
Ethical vegans and moral vegetarians not only follow a vegan diet but also exclude animal-derived products such as wool and leather from their daily lives.
They also try to abstain from using items such as cosmetics that underwent animal testing first.
`` This case, if successful, will establish that the belief entitles ethical vegans to protection from discrimination, '' Casamitjana's lawyer Peter Daly said in a statement.
Britain's 2010 Equality Act says a `` philosophical belief '' must be genuine `` and not an opinion or viewpoint based on the present state of information available ''.
The League Against Cruel Sports said it was not contesting that ethical veganism should be protected.
A separate hearing into the circumstances of Casamitjana's dismissal will be held at a later date.
`` As this is a hearing to decide whether veganism should be a protected status, something which the League does not contest, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further, '' a spokeswoman for the group said.

US places ban on Cuban defense chief,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
The State Department announced Thursday it was barring Cuba's defense chief from entering the US, citing what it called human rights violations in supporting the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
The department said General Leopoldo Cintra Frias, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba ( MINFAR), `` bears responsibility for Cuba's actions to prop up '' Maduro's leftist regime.
`` Alongside Maduro's military and intelligence officers, MINFAR has been involved in gross human rights violations and abuses in Venezuela, including torturing or subjecting Venezuelans to cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment for their anti-Maduro stances, '' Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
`` Dismantling Venezuela's democracy by terrifying Venezuelans into submission is the goal of MINFAR and the Cuban regime, '' he said.
The announcement bans Cintra Frias and two of his children, Deborah Cintra Gonzalez and Leopoldo Cintra Gonzalez, from entering the United States.
The United States is one of more than 50 countries which have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate interim leader of Venezuela. But Cuba, as well as Russia and China, continues to support the embattled Maduro.

Medicinal cannabis substitute can treat Parkinson's disease,"Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Australian researchers have demonstrated experimentally that a medication called HU-308 can lower involuntary movements termed dyskinesias, which are a side effect following years of treatment for Parkinson’ s disease. Dyskinesia covers twitches, jerking, twisting or simple restlessness but not tremor.
So far the benefits for the drug have been shown only in mice; however, the results are sufficiently positive as to signal the need for human trials. In mice HU-308 functions is as effective as another drug called amantadine, which is the only available treatment for dyskinesias ( other than cannabis). In addition, the combination of HU-308 with amantadine turned out to be even more effective compared with either drug used alone.
READ MORE: Virtual reality assists with the treatment of Parkinson’ s disease
According to lead researcher Professor Bryce Vissel ( University of Technology Sydney): “ Our study suggests that a derivative of HU-308, either alone or in combination with amantadine, may be a more effective treatment for dyskinesias and a much better option than using an unproven potentially harmful substance like cannabis. ”
The researcher cautions that not only does cannabis cause a ‘ high’ ( unwanted by many in this context), cannabis causes various effects, some of which are not beneficial in Parkinson’ s disease.
Where cannabis works on two brain receptors – CB1 and CB2 ( CB1 causes the psychoactive effect), the drug HU-308 only works on CB2.
The research has been published in the journal Neurobiology of Disease. The peer-reviewed research paper is called “ Targeting the cannabinoid receptor CB2 in a mouse model of l-dopa induced dyskinesia. ”

More low-alcohol and zero-proof drinks are expected to launch as booze alternatives in 2020. Consumers will also gravitate to 'functional plus ' drinks, bright colors, exotic flavors and unique textures in their beverages.
As beverage research company Imbibe puts it: “ Many beverage trends will be driven by health and wellness in conjunction with experience-culture and the state of the economy. ” ​
Social insights firm Fizziology reports seeing members of Gen Z discuss alcohol and drinking on social media less than previous generations. US consumers in general are more aware of and open about alcohol addiction and mental health, which is leading to a greater appetite for non-alcoholic and low-ABV drinks.
Jen Handley, co-founder of Fizziology, said: “ We foresee this trend continuing in the year ahead with more manufacturers, brands and restaurants providing a wider range of options for those wishing to either abstain or imbibe. ” ​
Premiumisation and functionality continue to be important to consumers in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage categories. More high-end mocktails will be prevalent, as well as beers and cocktails enhanced with functional ingredients like turmeric, blue majik, and coconut water, according to Imbibe. Hard kombucha is also likely to appear on more menus and grocery shelves.
Beverage development company Flavorman notes that consumers are becoming more attentive to what they put into their bodies. This will culminate in a boom of launches and higher demand of more ‘ functional plus’ drinks.
`` Consumers aren’ t just looking for a simple caffeine boost anymore: ‘ functional plus’ drinks are set to boom in 2020 as consumers look for functionality – and then some! `` ​ it says.
CBD is a clear leader of the category, sure to only grow within beverage. But Flavorman said new herbal ingredients will emerge, like dihydromyricetin ( DHM) as a remedy for hangovers and ashwagandha to manage stress and anxiety.
Imbibe agrees, and predicts that the next generation of functional beverages will include ingredient combinations that address multiple needs or harmonizing ingredients that help consumers fulfill a specific goal.
Energy drinks enhanced with sports nutrition ingredients will be the most popular hybrids, along with probiotic and prebiotic beverages, enhanced RTD coffee and the continued rise of CBD drinks.
Imbibe expect brands to ‘ go back to the basics’ by incorporating essential nutrients into beverages, like vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids and protein. Superfruits, vegetables and herbs will live alongside nostalgic flavors like s’ mores, birthday cake and creamsicle represented in better-for-you beverages.
“ Demand for beverages that support physical and emotional health will continue to be a catalyst for innovation, ” ​Imbibe said. ​
“ Consumers will seek out adventurous sensory experiences delivered through exotic flavors, bright colors and unique textures. ” ​
The rise in spiked seltzer’ s popularity this year was obvious, and Fizziology attributed its success to Gen Z and millennial consumers that liked the higher quality beverages with a ‘ cool’ brand aesthetic and relatively low sugar content.
Flavorman agrees, and says: “ The global craze for seltzer and sparkling water is only just beginning. As consumers continue to prioritize flavor over sweetness, experts at Flavorman predict that ‘ better-for-you’ beverages emphasizing bright and refreshing flavors are set to take center stage in 2020. ” ​
Specific flavors to watch in 2020 will come from botanicals, citrus, ginger and exotic foods. Flavorman said botanicals will add fresh, delicate flavor combinations that can stand without added sugars for taste. Basil, cilantro, lavender, elderflower, sorrel and orange peel are all expected to be popular.
Exotic flavors like dragon fruit, coconut and prickly pear will grow more common in beverages, alongside citrus flavors like grapefruit, tangerine, blood orange, meyer lemon and yuzu. These will have particular success paired in alcoholic and non-alcoholic seltzers.
And while ginger has been a popular drinks ingredient for some time now, Flavorman expects it to be used as more of a pairing in 2020 to brighten up fruit flavors.
“ As consumers become more health-conscious, these flavor trends reflect a market shift towards beverages that maximize on quality and functionality, all while packing a flavor punch, ” ​ Flavorman said.
Imbibe sees similar global flavors from Latin America and Asia like guava, chili, cayenne and cardamom growing in beverage use. Ingredients with bold colors like turmeric, beet, matcha, and butterfly pea flower will be incorporated to visually appealing beverages.
Nitrogen-infusions and whipped ingredients will cause a rise in beverages with a creamy texture, chewable ingredients like boba and basil seeds will also become more prevalent.

In a social media post, Madonna is seen pole dancing on the beach to Frankie Valli’ s classic hit ballad “ Can’ t Take My Eyes Off You, ” and lipsynching it. She sipped wine and appeared to be having a good time, and didn’ t let her injuries bring her down.
The “ Material Girl ” acknowledged in an Instagram post that the one lesson she learned in life is that she has no regrets, ever.
She explained that life is a journey and a process. She elaborated that “ we all make mistakes and we learn from them and we move on. ” She noted that 2019 kicked her butt and subsequently taught her some “ very expensive lessons, ” however, she wouldn’ t trade them for anything for what we risk and value.
Madonna concluded her post by expressing her gratitude. “ I am so very blessed and grateful for all the beautiful experiences and souls I have encountered and created with and fallen in love with this past year, ” she exclaimed, prior to toasting to another “ decade of dreams. ” She also hashtagged the following words: new beginnings, health, happiness, and love.

Three Industrial Giants You Should Own In 2020,"
With the end of the year just around the corner, it’ s past time to think about positioning for 2020. When it comes to earnings power in 2020, the Industrial sector is going to be the market leader and that is where I like my money to be. To be clear, when I say Industrial Sector I mean the S & P 500 Industrial Sector as represented by the ETF ( XLI). Yes, the Energy Sector is expected to post EPS growth double that of the Industrials but investors should take that news with a grain of salt.
The Energy Sector’ s ( XLE) consensus EPS growth estimate for 2020 is 21% but only after falling -28% this year. The Industrial Sector is expected to grow by 15% next year ( 2nd fastest pace for the S & P 500) after contracting only -3% this year. That means the Energy Sector’ s earnings will still be down on a two-year basis while the Industrial’ s will rise. Energy may yet turn out to be a good investment for 2020 but, on an earnings basis, the Industrials are a much better choice.
Don’ t Bet On Boeing
Boeing ( BA) is by far the largest holding within the Industrial Sector SPDR but not an investment I recommend at this time. At just over 8% it outweighs the # 2 holding, Honeywell ( HON), by nearly 200 basis points and that is why the XLI is not the best choice for investors today. With the 737-Max scandal still raging it is unlikely Boeing will back in 2020. The most recent news on that front is the ousting of CEO Dennis Muilenberg. Muilenberg has been in charge of Boeing since 2015 and key to the 737-Max crisis, the board decided it was in the company’ s best interest to find someone else.

After decades of being anti-tech... what is making Buffett going all in now? And what is this new technology that America's biggest companies are in a race to implement?
There are several stocks within the XLI portfolio on the move and looking bullish. The three I want to highlight today are uniquely set up for 2020 and we can give thanks to the trade war for that. Caterpillar ( CAT), Deere & Company ( DE), and Cummins Inc ( CMI) have all seen their business deteriorate due to the trade war issuing downgrades and missing estimates. Now, with the Phase One Deal in sight, that is all about to change. Once the deal is signed and the details are well known we can expect to see a flurry of analysts upgrades for these stocks and this sector.
Cummins Inc, On The Move
Cummins Inc is a maker of engines and components for heavy industrial trucks. The company has been suffering due to softening demands for those trucks but you wouldn’ t think so looking at the share price. The price of Cummins has risen nearly 30% since hitting a bottom last August and looks ready to continue rising in 2020.
The outlook for growth, and the impact of the Phase One Deal on that outlook, are only part of the reason Cummins is on the move. Cummins is also a solid dividend payer and a prolific buyer of its own stock so a great way to capitalize on this industry. At today’ s prices, the stock yields close to 3% and has a 14-year history of distribution increases. The XLI only pays aobut 1.9%. As for buybacks, the board just announced another $ 2 billion in buybacks slated for 2020.
Deere & Company, China Is The Key To Growth
Deere & Company, that iconic maker of tractors, recently downgraded its outlook for 2020 due to the trade war. The company says lingering trade tensions played a big roll in the decision which makes the Phase One Deal of particular importance. The idea is that, once the Phase One Deal is signed, trade with China will reinvigorate growth globally, not just in the China segment of the business.
Looking at the earnings picture, Deere & Company will be one of 2020’ s best EPS growers despite the recent downgrade to guidance. The consensus estimate for EPS is $ 11.02, a 27% increase from 2019. Like Cummins, Deere & Company is a dividend payer and an attractive one at that. The yield is a little low, only 1.75% at today’ s prices, but it is a safe 1.75%. The payout ratio is only 27% of next year’ s earnings which also leaves plenty of room for an increase.
Caterpillar, A Dividend Aristocrat For Capital Gains In 2020
Shares of Caterpillar have been on the move in the second half of 2019 too. The stock is up more than 31% in the last four months and may easily match that gain in 2020. While the business has been struggling this year, the impact of tariffs has not been as great as feared. In addition, Caterpillar’ s CEO says many of its businesses have “ significant potential upside. ”
On a technical basis, the stock is forming a Bullish Flag Pattern with a $ 36 flag-pole. If, when, the pattern confirms traders can expect the stock to rise as much as or more than $ 36. Such a move would put the stock at a new all-time high. Regarding the dividend, Caterpillar is a Dividend Aristocrat with 26 years of distribution increases under its belt. The yield at today's prices is about 2.8% with a low 38% payout ratio.
6 Stocks That Will Benefit From a Dovish Federal Reserve
The quaint correction that was labeled the “ tech wreck ” of 2018 seems like a distant memory to investors. What also seems like a distant memory is any thought of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. At the end of 2018, the Federal Reserve had raised its benchmark federal funds rate. With the trade dispute with China dragging on, there was increasing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates. When interest rates are lower, stocks will generally rise as investors have no other option for growth. In July 2019, the doves got their wish. But in a move that now seems to be a “ what did they know move ”, the Fed dropped rates again in October. The market soared to record highs in January and early February. Since mid-February however, the market has fallen dramatically, and the Fed juiced the market one more time by cutting rates down to levels not seen since the financial crisis. None of us know for sure when the U.S. economy will be opened up. And while stocks are still a good investment, not every stock is a smart investment at this time. But some stocks perform well when interest rates are falling and that’ s why we’ ve prepared this presentation. These six stocks stand to benefit from both low-interest rates and the unique economic conditions being brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.

My experience of surviving cancer twice,"“ Helen, I’ m so sorry to tell you that you have stage 4 ovarian cancer. ” I will never forget hearing those words.
Cancer treatment was pretty grueling in the 1980s, and outcomes were a lot gloomier than they are today.
. My life flashed before my eyes. I was in disbelief. How could I have cancer for the second time in my life?
at the age of 32, just 2 years after I had given birth to my daughter, Julianne.
I received my diagnosis of breast cancer in 1972, and in those days, treatment was limited. The surgeon believed that a radical mastectomy of my right breast would give me the best outcome.
The doctor would prove to be correct, but I was no less devastated in the interim. I was the mother of three children, and instead of tending to my active children, I now needed to focus on my health and well-being.
However, I continued to live a blessed life. I was the wife of an Orthodox priest, a secretary, and a preschool Sunday school teacher. I was like any other mother, trying to prioritize my life. The difference being, if I got my priorities wrong, it could cost me my life.
The second episode began almost 2 decades later when I woke up feeling very bloated and fatigued.
I didn’ t think much of it at first and thought I would feel better the next day. Yet the bloating continued, especially after eating, and I began feeling pressure in my lower abdomen. I decided it was time to contact the family physician.
showed nothing. My doctor thought it was a case of gastritis and that I needed to rest and relax. However, 2 years later, my belly was now protruding, and I felt horrible pressure, so I asked my doctor for another test. This time they ordered a
.
The CT scan showed something was not right, and I would need exploratory surgery to get more information. They found ovarian cancer tangled and webbed intricately through a large part of my lower anatomy.
The surgery lasted many hours, and my surgeon believed he had debulked 90% of the cancer. He also told me that I needed to undergo
.
Cancer treatment was pretty grueling in the 1980s, and outcomes were a lot gloomier than they are today. I had already beaten cancer once, and the chance of surviving a second round seemed bleak.
I was offered a cocktail of Cisplatin, anthramycin, and Cytoxan as my best defense. Chemotherapy lasted 7 hours a day, and my side effects lasted even longer.
I was unable to complete my final round of chemo as my white blood count dropped too low. My oncologist thought the last round of chemo might have done more harm than good, so he discontinued the therapy one month short of 6 months.
The surgeon didn’ t mention a survival time frame to me, of course. He knew I had enough on my mind and didn’ t need to tell me that the consensus was that I had 6 months to live.
I guess God had a different plan.
I was sitting at the dinner table, having no appetite, looking frail and gaunt, with numbness and tingling in both my hands and feet. I was so tired and thinking that I can’ t go on.
I didn’ t realize that I had said that out loud until I was snapped out of my daze by my daughter telling me: “ You can’ t give up, you already lived longer than the doctor said you would. ”
I was shocked. I expected to be gone already but felt emboldened by the fact that I wasn’ t.
Like a boxer in the late rounds of a fight, I summoned energy I didn’ t know I had. I vowed to not only go another round but to win this fight. I did it once, and I’ ll do it again.
I got a second wind, but I needed something more, so I began exploring other avenues to find my cure. This wasn’ t an easy task in the days before internet searches, and it would take considerable effort.
In retrospect, I feel there were three things I did that helped in my healing and recovery. The surgery and chemotherapy were a big part of my treatment plan, but I knew I couldn’ t sit back and relax and let the doctors do all the work.
I went to church many nights, sometimes by myself. With my head bowed and body low, I asked God for forgiveness and strength, and to help rid me of any anger or resentment I had. As the wife of a priest, I received a lot of support, and people began praying for me all over the United States.
I also began juicing ( long before the juicing craze began). I juiced mainly carrots, and once in a while, I would add garlic or an apple. I actually developed carotenosis, a condition that turns your skin orange — I drank so much carrot juice that I looked like a carrot!
, and I found it easy to digest. The juicing seemed to provide me with energy, so I could continue to take care of my daily needs and responsibilities.
The third and possibly the most interesting approach that I discovered through a dear friend was a technique called “ hands on therapy ” by Janet Ziegler.
I met Janet through a friend, and during the introduction, I told her my name is Helen, and I have cancer. She turned towards me with a gentle, compassionate touch and told me, “ You are Helen, and you
cancer. ”
She taught me a process called visualization. It was as if she retrained my mind into thinking the opposite of what I knew as fact.
Before falling asleep that night, I remember asking God to give me a sign of a rainbow that things would be alright. It was that evening I clearly saw a rainbow full of vibrant color. I woke up the following morning feeling refreshed and thankful. Shortly after that experience, I no longer believed I had cancer.
The most difficult time in my recovery process was that first year. Once I developed a routine of self-care, I continued to nurture myself and focus on my loved ones. I slept a lot and took many breaks.
Looking back, I really believe there was a time when I was in recovery that I stopped believing I had cancer. Perhaps I was in denial, or possibly my deep faith carried me through.
The days continued, turning into months and then years.
It’ s been 31 years since my battle with cancer. I’ m now a widow, a grandmother five times, and a most appreciative multiple cancer survivor.
I can genuinely say, I have experienced God’ s loving grace in what my oncologist says is a medical miracle. I want to reach out and tell anyone going through a similar trauma that if I can do this, so can you.
It may seem like there’ s no end in sight, but if you keep fighting, you too can win. I want you to close your eyes and imagine yourself beating the odds just like me.
31 years cancer-free.

With growing interest in low-to-no alcohol beverages, consumers are looking for more high quality, better tasting and widely available options. Toronto's Partake Brewing is leading the non-alcoholic Canadian craft beer market.
After forming the idea in 2013, founder Ted Fleming launched Partake’ s first near-beer to retail in 2017. The IPA is now one of five varieties available online, and in retail and on-premise locations in Canada and the US.
Fleming told BeverageDaily that throughout the brand’ s life, Partake has had a lot of interest from US customers, sharing that “ we started from day one with the view that the US market was a big opportunity for us. ” ​
The non-alcoholic beer market has since welcomed many new brands and varieties, and is growing in popularity in Canada and the US. Fleming sees a lot of similarities between the North American countries.
“ What we have tended to see in Canada is that product launches from the big international beer companies tend to come into Canada first, and then follow into the US, ” ​ he said.
This could be down in part to a higher penetration rate in Canada overall for non-alcoholic beer, he says; but also due to the fact the population is concentrated into a few urban centres ( the US, in comparison, being a much larger and populous country).
With the introduction of big beer alcohol-free launches, category awareness is trickling down to the smaller craft operations like Partake. This has supported the brand’ s expansion to the Pacific Northwest region of the US.
Partake is now available in more than 2,000 locations in Canada, Whole Foods stores in Oregon and Washington state in the US, and Total Wine & More. Fleming said sampling events at the Seattle and Portland marathons have been crucial for educating American consumers on the products’ high quality.
“ We get really strong and positive feedback about the taste of our beer and it being more or less indistinguishable from alcoholic beers for your average beer consumer. From a style perspective, there’ s definitely some regional preferences. In the Pacific Northwest, our IPA does particularly well, ” ​he said.
“ People know what beer should taste like, we just have to educate them through trial that our beers do taste the way beers are supposed to taste. That’ s why the sampling is fundamental. ” ​
Partake’ s five styles include the IPA, a Pale Ale, a Blonde Ale, a Stout and its most recent launch, a Red Ale. Each 12oz can is between 10-30 calories and 0.3% ABV. Fleming sees a lot of opportunity in the industry for even more health-conscious, low-alcohol options.
“ I totally think it has room to grow, I think we’ re just at the tip of the tip of the iceberg with respect to what opportunity there is out there for us. You’ re seeing the convergence of several trends right now. There’ s a generation that’ s growing up on craft beer taste and profiles, and there’ s an authenticity that comes with craft brewing companies that resonates with people, ” ​ he said.
In Canada, Partake has noticed a few alcoholic beer brewers dabbling in non-alcoholic products, but it’ s a small movement and mostly regional. Fleming said Partake is the only option in the craft non-alcoholic space that has a national and international footprint.
More breweries are taking small steps with lower alcohol beers in the 2% -4% range, rather than cutting the alcohol content completely.
“ We’ re not seeing the non-alcoholic space being adopted by established breweries in a significant way at this point, ” ​ Fleming said.
This has bolstered Partake’ s on-premise business, however. Fleming shared that as recently as a year ago, a lot of breweries with their own taprooms “ didn’ t want to have anything to do with ​ [ them ]. ” ​ But in 2019, Partake saw a ‘ huge number’ of brewery taprooms bring in Partake beverages.
Fleming called it a ‘ fundamental shift’ in how beer brewers viewed Partake, coming to the conclusion that they were not going to invest in a separate in-house non-alcoholic beer, but an alcohol-free was still valuable to offer to customers and keep up with demand.
With the health and wellness movement, people are actively trying to drink less alcohol and use it in fewer social situations. The low calorie and carb counts are attractive to those following special diets for diabetes, or paleo and keto.
For the US in 2020, Partake is looking to expand in Whole Foods nationwide, as well as Wegman’ s, Sprouts and regional Walmarts.
“ It all starts with taste, and there’ s been a long standing stigma around non-alcoholic beer being an inferior product and a compromised product. And I don’ t think it is a compromise anymore. ” ​

Michael Yourison has been in the business of importing olive oil, pasta products and wine from Italy to the US for nearly 11 years. And after giving up drinking alcohol five years ago, he came across a zero-proof wine in Italy that he wanted to bring to the US.
Yourison - now CEO of Buonafide Foods - found the US market to be underserved when it came to drinks that are totally alcohol free ( as opposed to those with up to 0.5%): opening up a market for Buonafide 0.0.
The beverage is fermented the same way wines are traditionally produced. The alcohol is removed with a reverse osmosis process, sent to a lab to verify it is completely free of alcohol, and then the bottles are dipped into a heated vat to pasteurize the drink and prevent future fermentation.
The process makes Buonafide a true wine that still contains polyphenol micronutrients - yet without the effects of alcohol, said Yourison. The drinks also have around half the calories and less sugar than regular wine.
While many non-alcoholic wines tend to be sweet and sparkling, Yourison wanted to create a dry wine that works with food pairings.
Buonafide’ s seven varieties are made with with Montepulciano d'Abruzzo and Passerina grape varietals. They include Bianco, Sparkling Bianco and Sparkling Extra Dry Taste Bianco, which are young, dry white wines. Rosso and Sparkling Extra Dry Taste Rosso are ruby red in color and everyday Italian table wines.
`` Alcohol-free alternatives continue to become increasingly popular and in demand for those who do not consume alcohol for any reason, '' ​ said Yourison. `` ​They provides the same ritual experience and sense of occasion that brings a feeling of inclusiveness and enjoyment with meals and entertainment without the negative effects of alcohol. `` ​
When entering the US market, Yourison wanted to partner with retailers that serve the health-conscious, alcohol-adverse consumer. Whole Foods stood out to him, and the Florida region is the first step. The wines are also available on the Buonafide website and in select bars.
Buonafide has been connected with Austin, Texas sobar bar Sans Bar since its launch in 2017: a venue that offers “ live music, a vibrant, upscale environment, and sober drinks that you won’ t find anywhere else. ” ​Sans Bar is taking the brand on its national tour of pop-ups this year; and Buonafide will serve as sponsor of the upcoming events.
Yourison said that consumers appreciate Buonafide for being a dry rather than sweet, grape-juice like product; and also work well as an accompaniment to food.
“ We do have some traction, and we’ re just looking to fill a need and a void for the people who are looking to have an alternative beverage to wine that doesn’ t have any alcohol, ” ​ Yourison said.

"Oil prices soar as US kills top Iranian general, fans war fears","Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Oil prices soared more than four percent Friday following news that the US had killed a top Iranian general, fanning fresh fears of a conflict in the crude-rich region, with Tehran warning of retaliation.
The head of Iran's Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, was hit in an attack on Baghdad's international airport early Friday, according to Hashed al-Shaabi, a powerful Iraqi paramilitary force linked to Tehran.
Later, Donald Trump tweeted a picture of the American flag, and the Pentagon said he had ordered Soleimani's killing.
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned of `` severe revenge '' for `` the criminals who bloodied their foul hands with his blood '', while the country's foreign minister called the move a `` dangerous escalation ''.
Brent surged 4.4 percent to $ 69.16 and WTI jumped 4.3 percent to $ 63.84 as investors grow increasingly worried about the effects of a possible flare-up in the tinderbox Middle East on supplies of the commodity. Both oil contracts later pared the gains but remained well up.
`` This is more than just bloodying Iran's nose, '' said AxiTrader's Stephen Innes. `` This is an aggressive show of force and an outright provocation that could trigger another Middle East war. ''
The killing of Soleimani is a dramatic escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran and comes after a pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy in Iraq following deadly American air strikes on the hardline Hashed faction.
The attack on the embassy highlighted new strains in the US-Iraqi relationship, which officials from both countries have described to AFP as the `` coldest '' in years.

Oil prices soared more than four percent Friday following news that the US had killed a top Iranian general, fanning fresh fears of a conflict in the crude-rich region, with Tehran warning of retaliation.
The head of Iran’ s Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, was hit in an attack on Baghdad’ s international airport early Friday, according to Hashed al-Shaabi, a powerful Iraqi paramilitary force linked to Tehran.
Later, Donald Trump tweeted a picture of the American flag, and the Pentagon said he had ordered Soleimani’ s killing.
Iran’ s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned of “ severe revenge ” for “ the criminals who bloodied their foul hands with his blood ”, while the country’ s foreign minister called the move a “ dangerous escalation ”.
Brent surged 4.4 percent to $ 69.16 and WTI jumped 4.3 percent to $ 63.84 as investors grow increasingly worried about the effects of a possible flare-up in the tinderbox Middle East on supplies of the commodity. Both oil contracts later pared the gains but remained well up.
“ This is more than just bloodying Iran’ s nose, ” said AxiTrader’ s Stephen Innes. “ This is an aggressive show of force and an outright provocation that could trigger another Middle East war. ”
The killing of Soleimani is a dramatic escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran and comes after a pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy in Iraq following deadly American air strikes on the hardline Hashed faction.
The attack on the embassy highlighted new strains in the US-Iraqi relationship, which officials from both countries have described to AFP as the “ coldest ” in years.

"On the road to AI adoption, execs grapple with expertise and data","CIOs kicked off 2019 with AI as an item to watch in the competition agenda. In 2020, adoption of this technology is more likely to predict market dominance.
The levels of adoption cited in the IBM study add confirmation to the trend of increased AI usage. Gartner's CIO survey, published in January 2019, found 37% of enterprise leaders had adopted AI or planned to do so shortly.
`` If you are a CIO and your organization doesn't use AI, chances are high that your competitors do and this should be a concern, '' said Chris Howard, distinguished research vice president at Gartner, in the press release accompanying the survey.
Amid a landscape marked by augmented workers and redefined business models, companies that fail to overcome the knowledge, data and tool barriers to AI adoption are at risk of ceding ground to the competition.
It's a trend IBM hopes to capitalize on, with tools like IBM Watson promising to address real-world problems.
`` While there is still work to be done, advances in data discovery and management, skills training and AI explainability are driving the rate of AI adoption faster than many predicted, '' said Rob Thomas, general manager at IBM Data and AI, in a blog post accompanying the survey results.

Labor Stocks Are Going To Break Out In 2020,"
The labor markets were one of the most closely watched segment of our economy in 2019. Despite all the naysaying, the labor market ended the year on the most solid footing its been on in the history of the U.S. The size of the labor force is the largest its ever been, the unemployment rate is trending at historic lows, more minorities are working than ever before, wages are rising at a +3% clip, and the outlook for 2020 is just as robust.
If you are worried about what may happen in labor trends this year let me reassure you, the labor market will come to a boil in 2020 and push labor-related stocks to new highs. A recent survey by Manpower, Inc revealed employers are not scaling back their plans for hiring in 2020.
According to Manpower’ s survey of 11,500 U.S. employers, only 5% of businesses are planning to cut back on employment. On a seasonally adjusted basis, fully 19% of businesses are planning to expand their workforces in the first quarter of the year while the remainder are going to maintain the workforces they’ ve already built.
Manpower, Inc Will Cash In On Labor Shortages
Manpower, Inc ( MAN), an international firm specializing in staffing and recruitment services, is going to cash in on labor market shortages. Two of my favorite data points, the number of available workers and the number of open jobs, help drive the reality of this situation home.
According to the Employment Situation Report, AKA the Non-Farm Payrolls Report shows 5.8 million American workers ready to go to work right now. The JOLTs report, Job Openings and Labor Turnover, shows upward of 7.3 million open jobs. That’ s a deficit of roughly 1.5 million employees, a fact that will make recruitment and retention a top-priority in 2020.

NativeDisplayAdID=585 & ImpressionID=0 & UserID=0 & Placement=PlaceOnArticlePage '' > '); If you own a cell phone, then mobile service providers hope you never get to see this video going viral. It was shot in downtown Denver by a multi-millionaire, who exposed sensitive truths about cell phones and 5G. His experiment will strike a bad chord with cell phone companies, I know. But you’ ve got to see what this man “ leaked, ” and what it means for phone users in the weeks ahead.
Analysts are expecting Manpower, Inc to produce about 4% EPS growth next year but this is a low estimate. Momentum within the labor economy coupled with the gross-shortage of employees is going to drive business in the New Year.
At only 13.5X forward earnings Manpower is trading at the lowest valuation of any labor market stock I track. The stock is also paying 2.25% in yield which compares favorably with the broad markets average P/E of 19.5 and yield of only 1.75%. Manpower is also a dividend grower having raised its distrubution for the last 9 years with a 17% CAGR.
ADP, Cloud-Based Services For Employers Are In Demand
ADP ( ADP) is another labor market stock in good position to cash in on employment trends in 2020. The company provides cloud-based solutions for employers that include payroll processing, insurance, retirement benefits, and human resources applications.
At today’ s prices the stock is one of the more highly valued, trading at 27X forward earnings, but that’ s easy to overlook when growth is in the forecast. Analysts are expecting ADP to grow revenue by 6% and deliver a near 12% increase in EPS. Couple this with the stocks newly acheived Dividend Aristocrat status and you have a recipe for double-digit total returns.
The stock is currently in an uptrend and consolidating just shy of recently set all-time highs. The indicators are bullish and point to a test of resistance at least. Resistance is near the $ 172 level, a break above this level would be bullish and bring targets near $ 215 into play.
Cintas, The Best Play On Labor You Can Buy
Cintas ( CTAS) is another Dividend Aristocrat and the best play on labor market conditions you can buy. Trading at 30X forward earnings it is not a cheap stock but that is offset by its outlook for growth. The company has been growing organically in the high-single-digits for year and shows no signs of stopping. The company is also actively growing through acquisitions that promise to boost returns in the coming years.
What does Cintas do? Cintas is a provider of employer and employee services that include uniform rentals and delivery, safety products and first aid solutions. Analysts are expecting the company to deliver 6% revenue growth this year and produce 10% earnings growth. Because the company has been successfully cutting costs and widening margins, partly due to synergies realized through acquisitions, the consensus estimates for 2020 are likely too low. Over the past three years, the company has only missed estimates once.
Other than the yield, sub-1%, the dividend is quite good. The payout ratios is super-low at 28% which means the company could sustain dividend increases without the expectation of future earnings growth. The distribution has been increased every year for 28 years so there is a high expectation of future increases. Couple this with the growth outlook and the odds of Cintas uptrend continuing are quite high.
The stock has been in a protracted uptrend for a decade, coincident with a labor market expansion that began following the global financial crisis. Price action is now consolidating at the fresh all-time highs and on the verge of a major break out. The indicators are still mixed but set up to produce a trend-following swing in momentum that could easily take this stock to new all-time highs during the 1st quarter of 2020.
6 Stocks That May Not Survive the Coronavirus
Companies that are in a shaky financial position may sometimes attract investors in a bull market. Traders seeking a short-term profit can often use an oversold condition to capture a quick gain. But in a bear market, these companies frequently are left on the sidelines. But a declining stock price by itself should not be enough to scare investors off. What investors really need to pay attention to is the company’ s ability to finance existing debt or take on additional debt. Companies with low credit ratings face the problem of having too much debt on their books and an inability to finance it at more favorable rates. That’ s one reason we’ ve put together this presentation that highlights 6 companies that may not survive the coronavirus. These companies have low stock prices. In fact, many of them are, or will be, in danger of being delisted if they can not bring their stock above the $ 1 threshold. And on top of that, these companies each carry credit ratings of CCC+ or lower and are at risk of seeing those ratings even go lower. Each of the companies presented here are considered to be among the weakest, if not the weakest, in their sector. If you have any of these falling knives in your portfolio now is the time to cut your losses and walk away.

Mysterious Respiratory Virus Strikes 44 People in China,"By Nicoletta Lanese published 3 January 20
People have speculated that the viral infection may be a highly contagious disease called SARS.
An unidentified form of viral pneumonia has struck several dozen people in the Chinese city of Wuhan, sparking concerns that the country may be facing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS).
Back in 2002 and 2003, SARS spread to 26 countries, infecting more than 8,000 people with a severe, flu-like illness and claiming more than 750 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC). The outbreak began in China, where 349 people died from the disease on the mainland and 299 more perished in Hong Kong, according to Asian news channel CNA. The SARS virus spreads through person-to-person contact and can be expelled from an infected individual when they cough or sneeze, contaminating both people and nearby objects. The World Health Organization ( WHO) declared that China was free of SARS in 2004, but now, a mysterious bout of viral illness has led to speculation that the disease is back.
Forty-four cases of the unidentified illness have been reported so far, including 11 `` severe '' cases, according to the international news agency AFP. Many of the infected individuals were stall holders at Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which health authorities have closed until further notice, according to the South China Morning Post. In a further effort to contain the outbreak, airports in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan have ramped up screenings for fever among their passengers.
Related: The 9 Deadliest Viruses on Earth
The cause of the infections remains unknown, but the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has ruled out `` influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases '' as potential culprits. `` At this point, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak, '' said Gauden Galea, WHO's representative in China, AFP reported.
In response to speculation about a SARS outbreak, the Wudan police announced Wednesday ( Jan. 1) that eight individuals had been punished for `` publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification, '' the AFP added.
`` If it were SARS, we are experienced in managing it, '' Emily Chan Ying-yang, a medical professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a visiting professor at the University of Oxford, told the South China Morning Post. `` But if it is a new strain, then we should pay attention. ''
During the 2002 outbreak, SARS caused many fatalities among young people, so it's important to determine whether serious cases of the virus are occurring in young or elderly individuals, she added.
The mystery pneumonia may also be caused by a rare virus or one that was previously unknown, Dr. Jiang Rongmeng of Beijing Ditan Hospital told the South China Morning Post.
Unlike in the 2002 SARS outbreak, `` no apparent human-to-human transmission has been detected so far. Otherwise, there would have been a community outbreak with more infections, '' Rongmeng added.

California’ s chief regulatory agency for oil and natural gas development has been renamed going into the new year, with a focus on public health, safety and environmental issues within the energy sector.

The newly named California Geologic Energy Management Division ( CalGEM) replaced the Department of Conservation’ s ( DOC) Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources.

CalGEM, created last year by Assembly Bill 1057, comes as the state’ s once robust oil and gas industry is steadily shrinking while low-carbon energy sources are growing.

DOC Director David Shabazian said the division’ s mission has evolved since it was founded more than 100 years ago and now is focused on protecting public health, safety and the environment while guiding the state to a “ low-carbon future. ”

CalGEM is charged with reducing and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions; requiring increased financial protections from onshore operators on the integrity of their operating and idle wells; and mandating additional documentation on changes in well ownership.

CalGem chief Udauk-Joe Ntuk said the division will not only expand its focus, but “ concurrently oversee energy production in a manner that aligns with the state’ s clean energy and climate goals. ”

Ntuk noted that California remains one of the nation’ s largest oil-producing states, even with a steady drop in volumes over the past 35 years. In 1985, total production was 424 million bbl, compared to a preliminary final total for 2018 of 161.8 million bbl.
